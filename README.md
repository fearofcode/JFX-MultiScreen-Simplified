JFX-MultiScreen
===============

Original code: https://github.com/acaicedo/JFX-MultiScreen

This repo does the following:

- Replaces string references with classes for better safety
- Removes animation for simplicity
- General cleanup to make code smaller

The original code was fine, I just think this shows the idea more clearly.
